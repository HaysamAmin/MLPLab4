**The goal of this project is to:**

This lab focuses on data tidying and cleaning as essential steps in the data engineering process.
Reshape messy datasets using melt() and pivot_table() to make them analysis-ready.
The lab also explores techniques to handle missing values and detect outliers using Z-score and IQR methods.

**Approach**

 Tidying: Reshaped messy data using melt() and pivot_table() for better structure. Cleaning: Handled missing values via dropping or imputation (mean, median, mode). Outlier Detection: Identified outliers using Z-score and IQR methods. Removal: Removed data points outside defined Z-score or IQR thresholds.
